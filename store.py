"""Generic SQLite access shared by :mod:`bot` and the feature modules.

Sentinel's per-feature modules (:mod:`tickets`, :mod:`applications`) keep their
own tables but must not import :mod:`bot` to reach the database helpers:
``bot.py`` imports those modules to register their cogs, so an import back into
``bot`` would be circular.

The helpers here are deliberately tiny and identical to the ones ``bot.py``
used before they moved: one connection per statement, opened ``with
closing(...)`` so it is always released, and rows returned as
:class:`sqlite3.Row` (``dict(row)`` when a plain mapping is wanted).

The path is read from :mod:`paths` on every call rather than captured at
import time, so a test that redirects ``SENTINEL_DATA`` before importing is
honoured, and an installed build that moved its data directory keeps working.

``bot.py`` imports these names and re-exports them, which is why the existing
``bot.db_execute`` call sites (and the dashboard, which is handed these
callables) keep working unchanged.
