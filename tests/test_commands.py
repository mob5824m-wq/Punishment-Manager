"""
Tests for the slash-command definitions (bot.py).

Motivation: ``/punish status`` (now ``/manage status``) shipped with a
101-character description. Discord limits every command and option description
to 1-100 characters, so at startup ``tree.sync()`` was rejected as a whole
(command names below are the ones from that incident)::

    discord.app_commands.errors.CommandSyncFailure: Failed to upload commands
    to Discord (HTTP status 400, error code 50035)
    In group 'punish' defined in module '__main__'
      In command 'punish status' defined in function 'PunishmentCog.punish_status'
        description: Must be between 1 and 100 in length.

Everything now hangs off a single ``/manage`` group, so these tests also pin
the consequences of that shape:

* only the top-level command is uploaded (guild copies are taken from the
  local tree, so the empty global upload cannot empty the bot);
* Discord applies ``default_member_permissions`` to the top-level command
  only, so the administrative sub-commands re-check for *Administrator* when
  they run - see ``test_admin_commands_refuse_non_admins``.

The bot logs that and keeps running (it has to: the scheduler that releases
punished members lives in the same process), so it looked healthy while Discord
never received the command list. discord.py does not length-check a description
that is passed explicitly and nothing exercised the tree before a release, so
the only way to find out was to deploy. These tests check the real command tree
and the automatic per-guild sync path offline, instead.

Motivation for the duplicate half of this file: the sync used to upload the
whole tree twice - once to Discord's *global* registry (``tree.sync()``) and
once per guild (``copy_global_to()`` + ``tree.sync(guild=...)``). Discord keeps
those two registries separate and the client lists a command from each of them,
so every server showed doubled ``/manage`` entries. The bot now syncs per
guild only and empties the global registry; the tests below pin that down,
including the empty global upload that removes duplicates.

Run with either:
