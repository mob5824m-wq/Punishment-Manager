Sentinel - a discord.py server management bot.

Everything is reached through one slash-command group, ``/manage``:

    /manage punish      temporarily swap a member's role
    /manage pardon      end that early
    /manage warn        record a warning without changing roles
    /manage warnings    list or clear a member's warnings
    /manage status      server config, active punishments, member history
    /manage setup       configure roles, staff channel and DMs (admins)
    /manage fixcommands clean up duplicated slash commands (admins)
    /manage rules ...   publish rule sets and their acceptance role (admins)
    /manage tickets panel      set the options and publish the panel (admins)
    /manage tickets category   list / add / edit / remove a panel button (admins)
    /manage tickets console    work the ticket queue (staff)
    /manage applications form    list / create / edit / delete a form (admins)
    /manage applications panel   publish an Apply panel (admins)
    /manage applications review  read submissions and decide (staff)
    /apply              fill in an application form (every member)
    /ticket             open a ticket (every member)

Members open tickets and submit applications through the buttons on panels
staff published, or with those two member commands; they can never list, view
or edit anybody's ticket or application. Its authenticated server-side web
dashboard manages connected servers, moderation, warnings, the rules post,
reaction-role menus, tickets, applications, configuration and history.
