"""Per-guild configuration lookups, shared by every Sentinel module.

These helpers used to live in ``bot.py``. They moved here so the feature
modules (:mod:`tickets`, :mod:`applications`, :mod:`rules`, ...) can resolve a
guild's staff role, notification channel and DM preference without importing
``bot`` — which imports them, so that import would be circular.

They are pure functions over the config dict: nothing here touches Discord or
the database, which is also what makes them trivial to test. ``bot.py``
imports every name below, so ``bot.get_guild_config(...)`` and the callables
the dashboard is built with are unchanged.

Two config shapes have to keep working (see ``DEFAULT_CONFIG`` in bot.py):

* the new single-server shape, where the roles live at the top level and
  ``server_id`` names the guild;
* the older multi-server shape, where each guild has an entry in ``guilds``
  and top-level staff settings act as defaults.

:func:`get_guild_config` flattens both into one view; the other helpers build
on it so they cannot disagree about which guild is configured.

    Moderation (punish, pardon, warn, warnings, status) is a *staff* job:

    qualifies. Discord's *Moderate Members* permission is deliberately not
    enough on its own, because a server can hand that permission to anyone,
    and those members should not be punishing people.

    Two deliberate exceptions:

    * **Administrators** always qualify. They choose the staff role in the
      first place, and an administrator can grant themselves the role in two
      clicks — refusing them adds friction, not safety.
    * A server that has **no staff role configured yet** keeps the historical
      permission rule (Moderate Members / Manage Server / Administrator), so
      moderation does not stop working on a first-run server. The refusal says
      how to switch to the staff-role rule.

    The return value is worded for the member who hit the wall, so callers can
    send it as-is.
